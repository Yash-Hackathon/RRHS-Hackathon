The sun peeked through the blinds.
Emma rolled over and grabbed her phone.
Emma sighed and opened the fridge.
Almost no milk left.
A cyclist sped past, nearly hitting the mailbox.
Someone shouted angrily.

The mail truck screeched to a stop.
Packages tumbled into the box.
Emma sipped her coffee.
Too hot.
She burned her tongue and groaned.




The toaster popped suddenly, making her jump.
Toast, at least, was reliable.

It paused, stared, and bolted for no reason.
A breeze

She smiled faintly and took another sip.
Maybe today would turn out better than expected.
