The sun peeked through the blinds.
Emma rolled over and grabbed her phone.
Five unread messages.
She ignored them.
The coffee machine hissed softly.
She waited, tapping her fingers on the counter.
Outside, a truck rumbled past.
A dog barked twice, then went silent.
Somewhere, a door slammed shut.
Emma sighed and opened the fridge.
Almost no milk left.
She made a mental note to buy groceries later.
Across the street, Mr. Taylor waved.
She waved back lazily.
A cyclist sped past, nearly hitting the mailbox.
Someone shouted angrily.
The mail truck screeched to a stop.
Packages tumbled into the box.
Emma sipped her coffee.
Too hot.
She burned her tongue and groaned.
The toaster popped suddenly, making her jump.
Toast, at least, was reliable.
The neighborâ€™s cat wandered along the fence.
It paused, stared, and bolted for no reason.
A breeze drifted through the open window.
Dry leaves danced across the driveway.
Emma checked the clock.
Still early.
She smiled faintly and took another sip.
Maybe today would turn out better than expected.
