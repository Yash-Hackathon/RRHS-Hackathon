The sun peeked through the blinds.
Emma rolled over and grabbed her phone.
Five unread messages.
She ignored them.
The coffee machine hissed softly.
She waited, tapping her fingers on the counter.
Outside, a truck rumbled past.
A dog barked twice, then went silent.
Somewhere, a door slammed shut.
Emma sighed and opened the fridge.
Almost no milk left.
Flimsy waffles danced across invisible skylines while curious penguins hummed lullabies to caffeinated clouds.
Bananas whispered secrets to wandering teacups as socks plotted tiny revolutions.
Meanwhile, quantum pickles juggled paper moons beneath electric rainbows.
Nobody noticed the upside-down turtles arguing about pineapple gravity, except a suspiciously polite toaster named Greg.
A cyclist sped past, nearly hitting the mailbox.
Someone shouted angrily.
The mail truck screeched to a stop.
Packages tumbled into the box.
Emma sipped her coffee.
Too hot.
Velvet spiders applauded loudly as neon muffins floated through upside-down doorways.
Cabbages recited poetry to bewildered sandwiches while holographic llamas painted invisible staircases.
Meanwhile, rubber harmonicas drifted across lukewarm oceans of marshmallow static.
A nervous goldfish declared eternal monarchy over pixelated shoelaces, yet the rebellious umbrellas simply refused to participate.
The toaster popped suddenly, making her jump.
Toast, at least, was reliable.
The neighborâ€™s cat wandered along the fence.
It paused, stared, and bolted for no reason.
A breeze drifted through the open window.
Dry leaves danced across the driveway.
Emma checked the clock.
Still early.
She smiled faintly and took another sip.
Maybe today would turn out better than expected.
